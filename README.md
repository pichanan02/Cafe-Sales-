# Cafe-Sales

In the bustling city centre, a newly launched cafe quickly became a favourite among office workers, experiencing strong sales from the outset. The cafe introduced membership cards, building a loyal customer base. However, the cafe is grappling with inventory management challenges. It struggles to align product stock with fluctuating purchase demands, leading to situations where it either runs out of stock, misses sales opportunities or has excess stock, incurring unnecessary costs.

As Data Scientists, devise a strategy enabling the cafe to optimize its inventory levels. Utilising data from the Invoices Table (detailing individual customer transactions), the Items Table (providing information on store products), and the Customers Table (holding member customer data), we aim to develop a solution for precisely forecasting stock requirements to meet purchasing demands effectively.
